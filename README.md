# Try Sord

[**This is live on sord.aaronc.cc!**](http://sord.aaronc.cc)

Try Sord is an interactive playground for [Sord](https://github.com/AaronC81/sord), inspired by
sorbet.run.

This is only a front-end; unlike sorbet.run, the tool isn't executed in browser. Input code is 
POSTed to an instance of [sord-server](https://github.com/AaronC81/sord-server) running on Heroku.

This is still very much a work-in-progress, so any feedback is greatly appreciated.

Thank you to [Connor Shea](https://github.com/connorshea) for the idea!
